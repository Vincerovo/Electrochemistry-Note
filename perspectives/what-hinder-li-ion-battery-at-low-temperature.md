# What hinder Li ion battery at low temperature?

## 1 introduction



## 2 On bulk electrolyte

### 2.1 Phase matters

this part mainly discuss about the importance of electrolyte phase to well-operated cell at low-T

liquid phase: talk about electrolytes' melting point and importance to maintain a liquid phase.

early work to lower electrolytes melting point: Smart et al.; multicomponent electrolytes

The key here is to finding a low melting point solvent to reduce whole point down. And melting point was first parameter to think for solvent.

P.S. Although liquid electrolyte means a lot to low-T cell, electrolytes of solid state may have another shot on this issue.

then list the performance of solid state battery, and ice battery at low-T.

### 2.2 Conductivity and dielectric constant

Second parameter to screen low-T electrolyte. On the basis of melting points.

### 2.3 Solvation structure and Li+ transfer

This part was going to be the main part of part.2. And naturally shift to interface and rise up part.3

Advanced designing strategy, yet most reasonable.

Different from part .3, this part was focus on solvation structure's interfering bulk electrolytes' properties. 



liquid gas electrolyte.

## 3 On electrode-electrolyte interface

### 3.1 Solvation/Desolvation process

Binding energy with solvent

energy issue in this process.

multiple sheath

solvation and desolvation resistance/ a little talk about R~ct~

### 3.2 how SEI affect Li-ion batteries' low-T performance

- anion-derived high-F content SEI facilitate Li+'s transfer into electrode
- how temperature affect SEI
- SEI and Li deposition at low-T



## 4 On electrode

Won't separate into several chapter.

Just talk about Li+ diffusion hinder in the various electrode.



## 5 Conclusion
