First of all, there are hinders for graphite cell working normally at low temperature.  

Usually, graphite cells CAN work at -20 deg, and there are already commercial graphite materials for those cells. And lots of cellphones have already applied these cells since there still exist a market at high-latitude  area where average temperature is below zero.

And how good does these graphite cells perform?

[this para is for cell performance of commercial graphite cells with reference.]
