Fig.3h

> **The diffusion of Li ions in SEI are positively correlated with exchange current density (I**~~**0**~~**, Figure 3h).**\[60,61] The exchange current density of FN-SEI (I~~0~~=5.21 mA cm^-2^) is much larger than that in F-SEI (I~~0~~=0.15 mA cm^-2^) and NSEI (I0=0.06 mA cm^-2^). Compared with F-SEI and N-SEI, more abundant heterogeneous grain boundaries among LiF, LiN~~x~~O~~y~~, and Li~~2~~O in FN-SEI in the closest vicinity of Li metal contribute to rapid Li ions transport definitively.

Fig.5d

> Using the LAV electrolyte could effectively reduce the voltage hysteresis by ≈64% (Figure 5c) compared to that in the baseline carbonate electrolyte. The exchange current density i~~0~~ (mA cm^−2^) was further revealed by plotting log(i) as a function of the overpotential μ (Figure 5d), according to Tafel equation (with details being described in the “Experimental Section”). The obtained values of i~~0~~ are 2.62 and 3.55 mA cm^−2^ for the baseline carbonate and LAV electrolytes, respectively. **The higher i**~~**0**~~** indicates the faster charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface** in the LAV electrolyte compared to the baseline carbonate electrolyte.

Fig.3a

> Comprehensive electrochemical characterizations were performed to **evaluate the kinetics of Li migrating beneath the SEI.**\[18] The Tafel slopes of all samples were probed and obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles in Figure 3a. The exchange current density (j~~0~~) are calculated from the corresponding Tafel plots **to reflect charge-transfer kinetics in SEI formed in different electrolytes**. As shown in Figure 3b, the N~~0~~F~~10~~, N~~2~~F~~8~~, N~~4~~F~~6~~, N~~6~~F~~4~~, and N~~8~~F~~2~~ electrolyte demonstrated increasing exchange current density of 0.41, 0.45, 0.61, 0.68, and 0.69 mA cm^-2^, indicating the faster kinetics of SEI and thus adequate Li ion beneath SEI to achieve spherical Li deposition.

Fig.4a

> The Tafel plots (Fig. 4a) indicate the relatively slower kinetics in the DMC-based electrolyte. Because of this, there is a distinct Tafel (linearity between potential and logarithm of current) regime, whereas with the DEC-based and ternary mixture, there is evidence for mass-transfer effects appearing earlier. The limiting currents may be related to the slow solid-state diffusion of Li in across the surface layer and/or graphite. The diffusion-limiting current, measured at an overpotential of 400 mV, is the highest for the ternary mixture followed by DEC. Using the limiting current thus measured, the Tafel plots have been corrected for the mass-transfer effects by plotting logarithm of $$I(1-\frac{I}{I_{lim}})$$) against the electrode potential. The corrected Tafel plots (Fig. 4b) are fairly linear. The rate parameters for the deintercalation of lithium, i.e., exchange current density and transfer coefficients were calculated from the intercept and slope of the corrected anodic Tafel plots, respectively. The exchange current density is the least for the DMC-based electrolyte as also observed in the micropolarization. Similar Tafel measurements were made at low temperatures also, i.e., 0 and -20$^\circ C$. The exchange current density decreases appreciably at low temperatures, similar to the values from micropolarization. At low temperatures, the electrolyte containing the DMC once again shows the lowest exchange current density.
